>This script is provided for **task 1** & **task 2** and **tile and Augmentation Preprocessing**.
>This script is privately provided by Mohamad NAJAFI for the DiaDeep PhD applicant task. The task consists of three parts, and all the necessary scripts have been provided to achieve the requested results.
The description of task is provided as [Segmentation: WSI and U-Net Pipeline Manipulation](https://informationsharing.notion.siteSegmentation-WSI-and-U-Net-Pipeline-Manipulation-82a91afd8c24478f8be89c61bd04ba85).

> It should be mentioned that the main challenges and important points are as follows for me:

- The 'annotation.csv' file cannot be read as a dataframe because all the data is stored in the first column of the CSV file. Additionally, there is an issue with reading the LINESTRING format of the geometry data. This requires parsing the data to obtain WKT or OPENCV geometry data, which needs to be addressed.
- I have experience in TensorFlow and Keras for DML and DL applications, however, I tried to not use tf libraries and just work with **torch** in this project.


> I am available and open to optimizing this script for various WSI image segmentation purposes. Having gained a better understanding of its functionality, I believe it would be applicable to focus on a specific class of annotation terms or a selected tissue for further refinement. Additionally, to achieve superior results, I've prepared a pilot format for fine-tuning SMP models using predefined weights. This can be applied to an augmented dataset generated by me from tiles of the original image, especially when ample image data is available and can be processed on a robust server.


> I am available to offer explanations or make modifications to this script based on your specific inquiry.

The first part of the task is to prepare the data with its label mask which results from geometry data that results from 'annotations.csv' file and the main image 'm9de8lfp.tif'. I have done it by extracting geometry data from the original WSI image and use 'pylibs' and 'shapely' libraries.
the mask is obtained as follows:
